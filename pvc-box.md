Some learning:

* Always use purple primer
* Consider sanding smooth PVC surfaces lightly
* Don't rely on PVC cement for narrow strips, like gluing together orthogonal planes
* Use metal fasteners between parts
* Heat up and bend flat parts, if you need simple geometry. The bend radius is huge though.
* Burnt plastic and scorch marks will show through the paper, paint/prime them first to cover
* Spray paint sticks rather badly to PVC. Maybe sand/rough-up surfaces?
